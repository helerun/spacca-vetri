# Spacca i vetri

This project was developed as part of a web application course and has been published on the website [giuochini.it](https://www.giuochini.it/). It is a simple interactive game involving sound detection through the user's microphone.

## How to Play:
The game "Spacca i vetri" involves virtually breaking the glasses displayed on the screen. The player's objective is to break as many glasses as possible within the shortest time possible.

To play, you need to use the device's microphone. The sound produced by the user will be detected and used to simulate throwing objects at the glasses. The higher the sound intensity, the greater the effect of "breaking" the glasses.

Make sure your microphone is enabled, and you are in an environment with an appropriate level of noise for an optimal gaming experience.

## Credits:
This game was made possible thanks to the excellent teamwork of two young front-end programmers: [@helerun](https://github.com/helerun) and [@sara-musuruana](https://github.com/sara-musuruana). Their dedication and creativity made "Spacca i vetri" a reality.
